# Task tracker

This project implements the backend of a task tracker platform. It exposes the following features:

* Present visually a list of tasks in 3 different states: Planned, In Progress, Completed.
* Each task contains, name, description, estimate and state.
* The user needs to be able to add/remove and change the state of the tasks.
* Somewhere in the application you need to present an up to date status, adding up all hours for each state.

It doesn't offer any sort of authentication capabilities.
